I felt happy because I saw the others were happy and because I knew I should feel happy, but I wasn’t really happy.
-Roberto Bolano

You’re an insomniac, you tell yourself: there are profound truths revealed only to the insomniac by night like those phosphorescent minerals veined and glimmering in the dark but coarse and ordinary otherwise; you have to examine such minerals in the absence of light to discover their beauty, you tell yourself.
-Joyce Carol Oates, Small Avalanches and Other Stories
